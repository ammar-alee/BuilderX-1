# BuilderX Offline Build (a.k.a BOB the builder)

This is an offline build for the [BuilderX](https://builderx.io/) program. 

## How to run this?

Clone this repo
```
git clone <this repo> && cd builderx/src
```

```
py -3 server.py
```

The builder will be opened in a new browser tab.

## Navigating between projects
Every project has a url. To open a new project, just navigate to a new url.

For instance, http://localhost:9089/app/project1 and http://localhost:9089/app/project2 are two different project.

Use this to natigate between projects. We do not currently provide a good-to-go screen for selecting/creating/deleting projects. Your business

## Save location
Projects are saved under src/proj/<project name>

## Enjoy :)
